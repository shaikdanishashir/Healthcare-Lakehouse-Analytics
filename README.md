# 🏥 Healthcare Lakehouse Analytics Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an end-to-end Healthcare Analytics Platform using a Medallion (Bronze, Silver, Gold) Lakehouse Architecture.

The objective is to transform raw healthcare datasets into analytics-ready data and build interactive dashboards that support healthcare decision-making.

The solution processes patient, provider, organization, encounter, and claims data to generate actionable insights into healthcare utilization, patient demographics, and provider performance.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Healthcare organizations generate large volumes of operational and clinical data.

Without a structured analytics platform, it becomes difficult to:

- Monitor patient activity
- Analyze encounter trends
- Evaluate provider performance
- Understand healthcare utilization patterns
- Support data-driven decision making

This project addresses these challenges by building a healthcare analytics solution from raw data ingestion to dashboard visualization.

- Top Providers by Utilization

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

### Healthcare Network

- 1,163 patients received healthcare services.
- 61,459 encounters were recorded across the network.
- 5,056 healthcare providers contributed to patient care.
- 1,127 healthcare organizations participated in healthcare delivery.

### Demographic Insights

- The 65+ age group represents the largest patient segment.
- Healthcare demand is higher among senior populations.

### Operational Insights

- Wellness encounters are the most common healthcare interaction.
- A small number of organizations account for a significant share of total encounters.
- Provider utilization varies significantly across the healthcare network.
